I built an example of a corporate website consisting of an Express server and a client in the React system, in this code it is compiled in a React workspace
The folder structure is:
src/-> assets -> css -> lib -> page
To run the system, you must install: npm i && npm run dev
To log in to the system, you need a username and password. Username: 1 Password: 1. After logging in, a menu for creating a post will be displayed (not currently working).
